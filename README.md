Summary:
This small game is made by myself in Java. UI is mainly written in Swing, realized the function of moving, shooting over the tank, with the effect of the explosion, bullet, sound, and also implemented the load/store to record user’s score. After starting the game, use ‘W’, ‘S’, ‘A’, ‘D’ to control the direction of moving, ‘J’ is for shooting. Only 5 bullets are able to shoot at the same time.
